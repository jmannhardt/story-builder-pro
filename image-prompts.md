## Prompt 1 — The Sky Islands Workshop
**Story moment:** Chapter 1 — Introducing Aethermere and Zara's workshop

A sprawling sky filled with dozens of floating islands of varying sizes, connected by rope bridges and rainbow light-rails. Waterfalls cascade off the edges into mist. On one island in the foreground, a cozy workshop with an open door reveals a girl holding up a sparking wrench, grinning. A younger boy sits on the floor beside her surrounded by bolts. The style is colorful, whimsical, and detailed — like a Studio Ghibli film crossed with a steampunk picture book. Bright daylight, puffy clouds everywhere.

## Prompt 2 — The Islands Begin to Fall
**Story moment:** Chapter 3 — Cogsworth Island starts sinking

A dramatic scene showing a floating island beginning to tilt and drop from the sky. Buildings slide, trees lean, and waterfalls reverse direction as the island descends. In the foreground, a girl with a backpack and a small boy look out a workshop window in shock. Below the island, clouds swirl ominously. Dark chrome robots march across a neighboring island in the background, their red eyes glowing. The mood is tense and cinematic, with golden afternoon light breaking through storm clouds.

## Prompt 3 — The Chase Across the Sky
**Story moment:** Chapter 4 — Zara and Miles leap between falling islands

Two kids mid-leap between crumbling floating islands against a dramatic sky. The older girl wears spring-loaded boots and a backpack, stretching toward a distant island edge. The younger boy clings to her back with wide eyes. Behind them, an island tilts and breaks apart, chunks of earth and waterfalls scattering into open air. Chrome robots with glowing red eyes leap in pursuit. The scene is full of motion, wind, and falling debris. Action-adventure style, dynamic angles, vivid colors.

## Prompt 4 — The Moment of Doubt
**Story moment:** Chapter 5 — Zara almost gives up, Miles inspires her

A quiet, emotional scene on the edge of a crumbling floating island at sunset. A twelve-year-old girl sits with her legs dangling over the edge, an empty backpack beside her, looking defeated. Her seven-year-old brother sits next to her, small hand on her arm, looking up at her with earnest determination. The sky behind them is painted in oranges and purples, with distant islands silhouetted against the light. A few chrome robots are visible approaching in the background. The mood is tender and hopeful despite the danger. Painterly, warm lighting, Pixar-level emotional depth.

## Prompt 5 — The Foundry Triumph
**Story moment:** Chapter 6 — Zara flips the OFF switch

Inside a massive industrial foundry, a girl stands on a platform next to a giant glowing sphere (the Master Controller), her hand on a comically simple OFF switch. Around her, enormous chrome robots stand frozen mid-scan, their green scanning beams pointed at a worthless piece of scrap metal she tossed on the ground. Holographic blueprints float in the air. Conveyor belts full of half-built robots stretch into the background. The lighting is dramatic — the sphere casts blue-white light across everything. The girl is grinning. Cinematic, detailed, triumphant moment.

## Prompt 6 — Peace Restored
**Story moment:** Chapter 8 — Aethermere is saved, celebration at sunset

A breathtaking wide shot of the Floating Sky Islands at golden sunset, fully restored. Islands hover peacefully at different heights, reconnected by bridges. Friendly green-eyed robots work alongside people — carrying lumber, watering gardens, repairing rooftops. On a central island, a girl and her younger brother sit on a rooftop watching the sunset, the empty backpack between them, surrounded by grateful neighbors. The sky is painted in golds, pinks, and purples. The mood is peaceful, triumphant, and warm. Epic fantasy landscape, heartwarming, panoramic composition.
