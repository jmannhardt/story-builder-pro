## Quest 1: Illustrate a Scene

Create new artwork for any of the 6 story moments described in [`image-prompts.md`](image-prompts.md). Hand-drawn, digital, AI-generated — all styles welcome.

**How to submit:**
- Add your image to the `images/` directory
- Name it descriptively (e.g. `03_chase_scene_watercolor.png`)
- In your PR description, tell us which scene it illustrates and what tools/style you used

## Quest 2: Translate the Story

Translate `story-text.md` into another language so more families can enjoy it.

**How to submit:**
- Create a new file named `story-text.[language-code].md` (e.g. `story-text.es.md` for Spanish)
- Keep the chapter structure and formatting intact
- Mention your fluency level in the PR — native speakers and learners both welcome

## Quest 3: Write a Sequel or Spin-Off

Got an idea for what happens next in Aethermere? Write a short sequel, a side story from Miles's perspective, a prequel about Grandma Elara — whatever inspires you.

**How to submit:**
- Add your story as a new markdown file (e.g. `spinoff-grandma-elara.md`)
- Keep it kid-friendly
- Include a brief summary at the top

## Quest 4: Build Your Own Family Story

Use the prompt in [`prompt.md`](prompt.md) to interview your own family and generate a brand new story.

**How to submit:**
- Add your story to a `community-stories/` directory (e.g. `community-stories/the-garcia-family.md`)
- Include a note about who was interviewed and what AI tool you used

## Quest 5: Improve the Prompt

Have ideas for making the Story Builder Pro prompt better? More question types, better pacing, support for bigger families — we're all ears.

**How to submit:**
- Edit `prompt.md` with your improvements
- Explain what you changed and why in the PR description

## Ground Rules

- **Keep it kid-friendly.** This is a family project. Nothing scary, violent, or inappropriate.
- **Be kind in reviews.** Creative work is personal — give feedback the way you'd want to receive it.
- **One quest per PR.** Makes it easier to review and merge.
- **Have fun.** That's the whole point.
