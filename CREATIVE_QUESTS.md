## Quest 1: Illustrate a Scene

Create new artwork for any of the 6 story moments described in [`image-prompts.md`](image-prompts.md). Hand-drawn, digital, AI-generated — all styles welcome.

**How to submit:**
- Add your image to the `images/` directory
- Name it descriptively (e.g. `03_chase_scene_watercolor.png`)
- In your PR description, tell us which scene it illustrates and what tools/style you used

---

## Quest 2: Translate the Story

Translate `story-text.md` into another language so more families can enjoy it.

**How to submit:**
- Create a new file named `story-text.[language-code].md` (e.g. `story-text.es.md` for Spanish)
- Keep the chapter structure and formatting intact
- Mention your fluency level in the PR — native speakers and learners both welcome

---

## Quest 3: Write a Sequel or Spin-Off

Got an idea for what happens next in Aethermere? Write a short sequel, a side story from Miles's perspective, a prequel about Grandma Elara — whatever inspires you.

**How to submit:**
- Add your story as a new markdown file (e.g. `spinoff-grandma-elara.md`)
- Keep it kid-friendly
- Include a brief summary at the top

---

## Quest 4: Build Your Own Family Story

Use the prompt in [`prompt.md`](prompt.md) to interview your own family and generate a brand new story.

**How to submit:**
- Add your story to a `community-stories/` directory (e.g. `community-stories/the-garcia-family.md`)
- Include a note about who was interviewed and what AI tool you used

---

## Quest 5: Improve the Prompt

Have ideas for making the Story Builder Pro prompt better? More question types, better pacing, support for bigger families — we're all ears.

**How to submit:**
- Edit `prompt.md` with your improvements
- Explain what you changed and why in the PR description

---

## Quest 6: Soundtrack or Theme Song

Compose original music inspired by the story. A heroic main theme, a tense track for the robot chase, a gentle lullaby version of Grandma Elara's message — any genre, any instrument.

**How to submit:**
- Upload audio to a `soundtrack/` directory, or link to SoundCloud/YouTube/Bandcamp in a markdown file
- Note which scene or mood the track is meant for
- All formats welcome — full production, piano demo, even a hummed melody recorded on your phone

---

## Quest 7: Map of Aethermere

Design a detailed map of the Floating Sky Islands. Label key locations: Cogsworth, Foundry Island, Harvest Island, the Grand Plaza, the Bridleway Bridge, and anything else you imagine.

**How to submit:**
- Add your map to the `images/` directory (e.g. `map-of-aethermere.png`)
- Hand-drawn, digital, 3D render, pixel art — all styles welcome
- Bonus points for adding locations not in the story (what else is up there?)

---

## Quest 8: Character Profiles

Write detailed bios for the characters — Zara, Miles, Grandma Elara, Mr. Pemberton, the Skyguard, even Biscuit the mechanical dog. Personality traits, fun facts, inventor specialties, favorite foods.

**How to submit:**
- Add a markdown file to the repo (e.g. `characters.md`)
- Include at least 3 characters
- Feel free to invent backstory that fits the world

---

## Quest 9: Choose Your Own Adventure

Rewrite the story (or a chapter) with branching paths and choices. What if Zara went to Harvest Island instead of the Foundry? What if Miles pushed the OFF button? What if the backpack never ran out?

**How to submit:**
- Add your branching story as a markdown file with links between sections, or build it as an interactive web page
- Put it in a `choose-your-adventure/` directory
- Include at least 3 decision points

---

## Quest 10: Family Read-Aloud Script

Adapt the story into a dramatic reading script with assigned roles so a family can perform it together. Narrator, Zara, Miles, robot sound effects — the whole production.

**How to submit:**
- Add your script as a markdown file (e.g. `read-aloud-script.md`)
- Include character assignments, stage directions, and cues
- Note how many readers are needed (aim for 3–5 so a family can do it)

---

## Quest 11: Lesson Plan or Activity Kit

Create educational materials tied to the story — for teachers, homeschool families, or book clubs. Discussion questions, drawing activities, a "build your own invention" craft project, writing prompts.

**How to submit:**
- Add your materials to a `lesson-plan/` directory
- Target an age range (e.g. ages 6–10)
- Include at least 3 activities or discussion topics

---

## Quest 12: The Remix Challenge

Take the same 12 interview answers that built this story and write a completely different story from them. Same ingredients, different recipe. Floating Sky Islands + kid inventor + robot army + backpack of tools — but a totally different plot, tone, or genre.

**How to submit:**
- Add your remix to a `remixes/` directory (e.g. `remixes/remix-noir.md`)
- List the original 12 answers at the top so readers can see how you reinterpreted them
- Go wild — comedy, mystery, horror-lite, poetry, whatever fits

---

## Boss-Level Challenges

These are bigger creative projects — adapt the story into a whole new medium. Solo or team efforts welcome.

---

### Challenge A: Graphic Novel

Turn the story (or a single chapter) into a graphic novel or comic. Panel layouts, speech bubbles, the works.

**How to submit:**
- Add pages to a `graphic-novel/` directory as images or a PDF
- Include a note about your art tools and process
- Partial chapters are fine — even a few pages count

---

### Challenge B: Narrated Audiobook

Record a high-quality narration of the story. Voice acting, sound effects, background music — go as far as you want.

**How to submit:**
- Upload audio files to a `narration/` directory (or link to SoundCloud, YouTube, etc. in a markdown file)
- Note what tools you used (mic, DAW, AI voice, etc.)
- Single chapters or the full story both welcome

---

### Challenge C: Short Film or Animation

Bring Zara and Miles to life on screen. Live action, 2D animation, 3D, stop-motion, AI-generated video — any format works.

**How to submit:**
- Add a markdown file to a `video/` directory with a link to the video (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
- Include a short behind-the-scenes description of how you made it
- Even a single scene or trailer counts

---

### Challenge D: Video Game

Turn the story into a playable experience. A platformer jumping between sky islands, a puzzle game in the Foundry, a text adventure, a visual novel — your call.

**How to submit:**
- Add your game project to a `game/` directory, or link to it (itch.io, GitHub Pages, etc.) in a markdown file
- Include a short README with how to play and what engine/tools you used
- Prototypes and jam-style builds are welcome — it doesn't have to be polished

---

## Ground Rules

- **Keep it kid-friendly.** This is a family project. Nothing scary, violent, or inappropriate.
- **Be kind in reviews.** Creative work is personal — give feedback the way you'd want to receive it.
- **One quest per PR.** Makes it easier to review and merge.
- **Have fun.** That's the whole point.
