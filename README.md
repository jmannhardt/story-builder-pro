# Zara and the Falling Sky

A collaborative family story created with AI — built by interviewing each family member and weaving their answers into a kid-friendly adventure.

## The Story

**Zara Brightbolt** is a twelve-year-old inventor living on the Floating Sky Islands of Aethermere. When a runaway robot army awakens and starts copying every invention in sight, Zara and her younger brother Miles must race across crumbling islands to shut them down — armed with nothing but a magical backpack and their own ingenuity.

An 8-chapter story about creativity, sibling teamwork, and discovering that the best inventions come from your own mind.

## How It Was Made

The story was built using **Story Builder Pro** — an interactive process where each family member (Dad, Mom, Nick, Connor) answered 3 questions across 3 rounds:

| Round | Question Type   | Topics Covered |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 1     | Multiple choice | Setting, hero, villain, special item |
| 2     | Open-ended      | Plot twist, sidekick, robot powers, hero's name |
| 3     | Yes/No          | Ending style, emotional beats, action scenes, suspense |

Every answer shaped the final story.
