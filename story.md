# Zara and the Falling Sky

*A Story by the Mann Family*

## Chapter 1: The Girl Above the Clouds

The Floating Sky Islands of Aethermere were the most extraordinary place anyone could ever live. Hundreds of islands drifted lazily through an endless blue sky, some as small as a backyard, others as wide as whole cities. They were connected by swaying rope bridges, rainbow light-rails, and the occasional brave jump. Waterfalls poured off their edges and evaporated into mist long before reaching the world below — a world so far down that nobody even remembered what was there.

On the island of Cogsworth, in a workshop crammed with half-finished gadgets, twelve-year-old **Zara Brightbolt** was having a very good morning.

"It works!" she shouted, holding up a wrench that crackled with blue sparks. "It actually works!"

Her seven-year-old brother, **Miles**, looked up from the floor where he was sorting bolts by size (his favorite hobby). "What works?"

"The Reverso-Wrench! You point it at anything broken and it *un-breaks* it. Watch!" Zara aimed at a cracked teacup on her workbench. The wrench hummed. The crack sealed itself. The teacup was perfect.

Miles clapped. "Cool! Can it un-break my knee from when I fell yesterday?"

"That's not how — actually, I have no idea. Maybe don't test that."

Zara slid the wrench into her most prized possession: a battered brown **backpack** that hung on a hook by the door. The backpack looked ordinary — scuffed leather, fraying straps, a coffee stain from their dad. But it was anything but ordinary. Their grandmother, the legendary inventor Elara Brightbolt, had built it. You could reach inside and pull out *exactly* the tool you needed, no matter what. A sonic screwdriver? There. A grappling hook? There. A sandwich? Also there, though it was always peanut butter, which Miles said was "suspicious."

The backpack had one rule, though — one that Grandma Elara had stitched into the inner lining in tiny golden letters: **"It gives what you need, not what you want."**

Zara had never fully understood that. So far, what she needed and what she wanted had always been the same thing.

## Chapter 2: The Robots Wake Up

The trouble started at noon.

Zara and Miles were crossing the Bridleway Bridge toward the market island when they heard it — a deep, grinding **CLANG-CLANG-CLANG** echoing from the direction of the old Foundry Island. The Foundry had been shut down for years. Grandma Elara had built it long ago as a place to manufacture helper-bots: friendly little machines that delivered mail, watered gardens, and sang slightly off-key lullabies. When Grandma retired, the Foundry went quiet.

It wasn't quiet now.

"That sounds like machinery," Zara said, gripping the bridge ropes.

"That sounds like *trouble*," Miles said. He was seven, but he'd read a lot of books.

They ran to the edge of the nearest island and looked across the gap. Foundry Island was alive again. Smoke poured from its chimneys. And marching out of its enormous front gates, in neat rows of ten, were **robots**.

But these weren't Grandma's friendly helper-bots. These were taller, sleeker, and covered in dark chrome armor. Their eyes glowed red. They moved with sharp, mechanical precision. And they were building things — fast. As Zara watched, a squad of robots scanned a passing mail-bot with a beam of green light. Three seconds later, they had assembled a perfect copy of it — except bigger, meaner, and with claws.

"They're *copying* things," Zara whispered. "They scan an invention and build their own version. But twisted."

A siren rang out across the islands. People started running. A voice on the loudspeaker system crackled: *"Attention Aethermere! Unknown machines are spreading across the islands. Please remain calm. This is not a drill."*

Miles tugged Zara's sleeve. "We should go home."

Zara looked at the robots. She looked at her backpack. She looked at Miles.

"We should fix this," she said.

## Chapter 3: Copies and Chaos

Within an hour, the runaway robot army had spread to six islands. They were unstoppable — not because they were strong (though they were), but because of their terrifying ability. Every time someone used a machine against them, the robots **scanned it and built a better version**.

The Skyguard flew in on propeller-bikes. The robots scanned the bikes, built jet-powered versions, and outflew them. The farmers on Harvest Island aimed water cannons. The robots scanned the cannons and built ones that shot ice. Even old Mr. Pemberton's mechanical dog, Biscuit, got scanned, and suddenly there were fifty chrome Biscuits barking in unison.

"Whoever turned the Foundry back on gave them a copying program," Zara muttered, tinkering frantically in her workshop. She had her backpack on and was pulling tools out one after another — a signal scrambler (didn't work, they adapted), a magnetic net (they copied it), an EMP pulse generator (they shrugged it off and built two more).

Every tool she used, the robots learned from.

Miles sat in the corner, hugging his knees. "Zara, maybe we should stop inventing *at* them. They just copy everything."

Zara froze. She stared at her brother. "Say that again."

"They copy everything?"

"They copy *everything.*" Zara's eyes went wide. "Miles, you're a genius. That's not their strength — that's their weakness. We just have to figure out how."

But before she could think further, the floor shuddered. Then again. A deep, terrible groan echoed through the sky, like the world itself was in pain.

Zara ran to the window and looked out.

Cogsworth Island was **sinking**.

In the foreground, a girl with a backpack and a small boy look out a workshop window in shock. Below the island, clouds swirl ominously. Dark chrome robots march across a neighboring island in the background, their red eyes glowing. The mood is tense and cinematic, with golden afternoon light breaking through storm clouds.

## Chapter 4: The Sky Falls

The islands were falling.

Not all at once — it was more like dominoes. The robots had burrowed into the ancient Levitation Engines buried deep inside each island, the mysterious machines that kept them floating. They were copying the engines, ripping out parts, trying to build their own version. But the engines were Grandma Elara's most delicate work. You couldn't just copy them. When the robots tried, the engines broke, and the islands began to drop.

One by one, islands groaned, tilted, and started their long, slow descent toward the clouds below.

"We have to get to the Foundry," Zara said, grabbing Miles's hand. "That's where their main controller must be. If we shut it down, the robots stop."

"How do we get there? The bridges are falling!"

Zara reached into her backpack and pulled out a pair of **Bounce Boots** — spring-loaded shoes that could launch you fifty feet in the air.

"We jump," she said.

And so began the most heart-pounding chase of Zara Brightbolt's life.

They leaped from island to island as the sky crumbled around them. Zara bounced off a tilting rooftop, grabbed a dangling bridge rope, swung over a gap where an island had just been, and landed on a chunk of floating rock barely big enough for both of them. Miles clung to her back, his eyes squeezed shut, shouting directions he'd memorized from Grandma's old maps.

"Left! The garden island is still up! Jump to the fountain!"

Robots chased them — chrome figures leaping with copied Bounce Boots of their own. But Zara was faster. She knew the islands. She knew which bridges had secret handholds, which rooftops had trampolines (she'd installed them for fun last summer), and which islands had enough updraft to glide across on a wing-suit she yanked from the backpack.

They were two islands away from the Foundry when it happened.

Zara reached into the backpack for a grappling hook to cross the final gap.

Her hand closed on empty air.

She reached again. Nothing.

The backpack was **dead**. No hum. No warmth. No tools.

"No, no, no," Zara whispered, turning it upside down and shaking it. A single bolt fell out and pinged off the ground. "Not now. Not *now!*"

## Chapter 5: What You Need

Zara sat on the edge of the crumbling island, her legs dangling over nothing. The Foundry was right there — one island away, maybe sixty feet across open sky. Without the backpack, it might as well have been a million miles.

The robots were closing in behind them. She could hear their mechanical footsteps getting closer.

"I can't do it," Zara said quietly. She didn't say it dramatically. She said it the way you say something when you really, truly believe it. "The backpack's dead. I don't have any tools. Everything I invent, they copy. I'm just... I'm just a kid."

Miles sat down next to her. His legs dangled too, though his didn't reach as far.

"Zara," he said.

"What."

"Do you remember what Grandma stitched inside the backpack?"

Zara closed her eyes. *"It gives what you need, not what you want."*

"Maybe," Miles said slowly, in the careful way that seven-year-olds say things when they've been thinking very hard, "maybe it stopped giving you tools because tools aren't what you need right now."

Zara looked at her brother. He had a smudge of grease on his nose. His shoelaces were untied. He was the bravest person she'd ever met.

"They copy every *thing*," Miles continued. "Every gadget, every machine, every invention. But they've never copied an *idea*. They can't copy what's in your head, Zara. You don't need the backpack. You need *you*."

Something clicked in Zara's mind — not a mechanical click, but the kind that happens when you finally understand something that was true all along.

She stood up.

"Miles, I need you to do something for me."

"What?"

"I need you to yell really loud."

The mood is tender and hopeful despite the danger. Painterly, warm lighting, Pixar-level emotional depth.

## Chapter 6: The Plan That Can't Be Copied

Here is what Zara Brightbolt did with no tools, no gadgets, and no backpack.

She *thought*.

The robots copied inventions — physical things. They scanned objects with light and replicated them. But they couldn't scan a plan. They couldn't copy teamwork. They couldn't replicate a really, really good idea.

"Miles, when I say go, scream as loud as you can toward the Foundry. I need the robots to look at you for three seconds."

"Why three seconds?"

"Because that's how long it takes me to do something dumb."

Miles took a deep breath. Zara crouched at the island's edge. The robots behind them were twenty feet away now, marching forward.

"GO!"

Miles screamed. Not a scared scream — a battle cry. A seven-year-old, full-volume, I-eat-my-vegetables-and-I'm-NOT-afraid roar that echoed across the open sky.

Every robot head turned toward him.

Zara jumped.

Not with Bounce Boots. Not with a wing-suit. Not with any gadget at all. She jumped with her own two legs, arms stretched forward, aiming for a dangling rope bridge cable that hung from the Foundry's edge — one she'd spotted with her own eyes, not a scanner, not a device, just a girl who knew her sky.

She caught it. Her palms burned. She swung, climbed, and hauled herself onto the Foundry's platform.

The robots turned back — but Zara was already inside.

---

The Foundry was enormous, dark, and humming with stolen energy. Conveyor belts churned out robots by the dozen. Scanned blueprints floated on holographic screens — every invention from every island, catalogued and copied.

In the center of it all was the **Master Controller**: a huge pulsing sphere of light connected to every robot by invisible signals. Destroy it, and the army shuts down.

But it was guarded by a ring of the biggest robots Zara had ever seen — and she had no tools.

She smiled.

"Hey!" she shouted. "You want to copy something? Copy *this!*"

She grabbed a piece of scrap metal from the floor and held it up like it was the most important invention ever built. She waved it dramatically. She made buzzing noises with her mouth.

The guard-bots scanned it. Their processors whirred. They tried to build a copy. But it was just scrap metal. It did nothing. Their systems stalled, confused — *what is this device? What does it do? Unable to classify. Scanning again.*

While they were frozen in confusion, Zara ran straight past them, leaped onto the Master Controller's platform, and found the one thing she recognized: a single OFF switch, labeled in her Grandmother's handwriting.

She flipped it.

Around her, enormous chrome robots stand frozen mid-scan, their green scanning beams pointed at a worthless piece of scrap metal she tossed on the ground. Holographic blueprints float in the air. Conveyor belts full of half-built robots stretch into the background. The lighting is dramatic — the sphere casts blue-white light across everything. The girl is grinning. Cinematic, detailed, triumphant moment.

## Chapter 7: A New Kind of Engine

The robots stopped.

All across Aethermere, chrome figures froze mid-step, their red eyes flickering to blue, then fading to dark. They stood like statues on every island, on every bridge, in every garden they'd trampled.

But the islands were still falling.

The Levitation Engines were broken. Even with the robots shut down, Aethermere was sinking. Zara could feel the Foundry tilting beneath her feet.

Miles's voice crackled over a speaker system he'd somehow figured out how to use (he was seven, but he was *also* a Brightbolt). "Zara! The engines! The islands are still going down!"

Zara looked around the Foundry. Conveyor belts. Assembly lines. Thousands of deactivated robots. And a scanning system that could copy any invention perfectly.

"The robots can copy things," she murmured. "They copied weapons. They copied tools. But what if they copied something *good?*"

She ran to the Master Controller, flipped it back ON, and began reprogramming. She didn't have the backpack, but she didn't need it. She had her brain, her grandmother's old schematics carved into the Foundry walls, and a really, really stubborn refusal to let her home fall out of the sky.

It took her fourteen minutes.

When she was done, the robots woke up again — but different. Their eyes glowed green now, not red. And instead of copying weapons, they had new instructions: **copy the Levitation Engines. Fix every island. Rebuild what was broken.**

The robots scattered across Aethermere — not as an army, but as a repair crew. They scanned the one working Levitation Engine that Zara had rebuilt by hand, and they copied it perfectly, installing new engines in every falling island. One by one, the islands groaned, shuddered, and rose back into the sky.

By sunset, Aethermere was whole again.

## Chapter 8: What the Backpack Gave

That night, the people of Aethermere threw a celebration on the Grand Plaza Island. There were fireworks (launched by helpful robots), music (played by slightly off-key singing helper-bots, just like Grandma's originals), and more cake than anyone knew what to do with.

The robots moved through the crowd gently now, offering drinks and picking up dropped napkins. They weren't scary anymore. They were helpers — the way Grandma Elara had always intended.

Miles found Zara sitting on the edge of the plaza, feet dangling over the clouds, the backpack in her lap.

"Is it still dead?" he asked.

Zara reached inside. Her hand closed on something small and warm. She pulled it out.

It was a note, written in Grandma Elara's handwriting:

> *"Dear Zara — I always knew you'd figure it out. The backpack was never the invention. You were. Love, Grandma."*

Zara read it twice. Then she folded it carefully and put it in her pocket — not in the backpack. Some things don't need a magical container. They just need to be kept close.

"Hey Zara?" Miles said.

"Yeah?"

"Next time the sky falls, can I push the OFF button?"

Zara laughed, put her arm around her brother, and watched the fireworks paint the clouds in every color she could name and a few she couldn't.

The Floating Sky Islands of Aethermere drifted on, steady and bright, held up not by machines alone — but by the people who cared enough to fix them.

*The End.*
